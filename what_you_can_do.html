       Now we are on to the second page, What You Can Do. This page is all about what you can do to help this cause. The first way you can help is running a fundraiser. Fundraisers are easy to run and can be started by anyone, anywhere. A fundraiser is a way of getting money to help fund a charity. For example this charity beside the box is called Spring Up A Well their plan is to bring water to people who don’t have access by building wells. In conclusion, Fundraisers are an easy way to raise money for your cause and can help spread awareness about the cause as well.

        <div class="info-box-title"> Hands on trips</div>
        Another way you can help is by going on a hands on trip. This is by far the most expensive option although you will get the most out of it. Last year I went on a trip to Ecuador with a few kids in my grade on a trip ran by Me to We. We would go up to the mountains in Quito even above the clouds and not only would we get to see how they live up there but we also got to help them. We did a water walk which is how they get water every day, they have to walk to a stream and fill up a bucket with water. We also helped build a school and gave the previously built one running water. In conclusion, this way of helping the cause is the best since you really get to connect to the people and learn a lot.

    <div class="info-box">
        <div class="info-box-title">Spread awareness </div>

     You can also spread awareness, ways of spreading awareness are doing things like this website, doing fundraisers as I mentioned above, or even just speaking to your family or co-workers about the topic. Spreading awareness about topics is a great thing to do, It doesn’t take much time or effort and you get a really good feeling in your heart because you know that spreading awareness about this cause will end up helping someone.
