       SDG 6.1 is " By 2030, achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all." This essentially means to get everyone regardless of age,race,origin, and gender will have a reasonably easy access to safe and affordable drinking water sources. In countries like Canada and America we take water for granted and we don’t realize how important it is to daily life. Some people around the world don’t have easy access to clean water and spend their whole day getting water and boiling it to remove the bacteria just to drink or be able to cook their food.

        It is crazy for all the people who don’t have easy access to Clean Water. In Canada we think of water as just an everyday thing that comes out of our taps and shower heads, we couldn’t do most of the things we do daily without it and that’s why I find it so shocking to see the number of people without easy access like we have. Look on the why it's important
