       How does water affect health? Water plays an important role in the health of a person because if you don’t have water you can get dehydrated and die. The real problem here is that there is no way for some people to get water without it taking 4-5 hours out of there day. The process is like this, they leave their house with a couple buckets walk down to the stream which in some places can take 2 hours to get there then they fill around two-three buckets of water. This water is dirty and not safe to drink so these people need to walk all the way back and boil the water just so they can drink. This is unacceptable and that’s why I feel we really need to spread awareness about this topic.

       The lack of easy access really affects poverty since people spend their whole day getting water they can’t do any other important things. This is really a bad problem because people need to carry as much water as possible in one trip so they keep their children home instead of letting them have an education and since they have no education it is hard for them to find a job. This shows how having access to clean water goes into a much deeper problem causing people to not be able to get jobs and an education.

        <div class="info-box-title"> The amount of people without easy access to clean drinking water</div>

     The worst thing about this whole problem is the amount of people affected by this issue. If you look at the left side of the page you can see a chart. This chart incases the names of the top 15 countries with the lowest percent of people who have easy access to clean water. If you hover your pointer over a bar it will show the percent. For example let's take a look at Uganda, 42 million people live in Uganda and only 4 percent have easy access to clean water that’s devastating.
